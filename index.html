          <h3>Graphic Design</h3>
          <p>
            My first contact with graphic design was during my Honour's Degree
            in Art and Design. I'm truly passionate about this field and believe
            that extraordinary design can impact, if not even change people's
            lives. I've been working on my graphic designs for three years now
            and have gained a wealth of experience designing, be it a website or
            a magazine, or a business card, for example!

            alt="ux-design-illustration"
          />
          <h3>UX / UI Design</h3>
          <p>
            During my university degree, I had a class on "interaction design".
            Needless to say, I fell in love with it! The concept of user
            experience, user-friendly design and overall the changes one design
            can make in a person life... All of that made me eager to learn more
            and more about the importance of communication design and its impact
            on the users' experience.

          <h3>Web Development</h3>
          <p>
            I started my coding journey around 3 months now! I certainly don't
            have a lot of experience but I aim to learn and become a stunning
            developer capable of, alongside my other skills, create unique
            projects!

          <h3>Visual Art</h3>
          <p>
            <em>
              What we see is what the brain thinks is most practical. But if you
              are an artist, or think critically, you question what you see. You
              realise that reality is negotiable. The idea that reality can
              change is a very healthy one, since the notion of progress or
              change is rooted there.</em
